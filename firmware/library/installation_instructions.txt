Installation instructions for Mac

1.  install Mac Crosspack:  http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html

  This will install gcc for the AVR microcontroller and other related tools.

2.  plug in the board and turn the board on

3.  edit the Makefile

  Find the 'usbprogram' target in the Makefile in this directory and change the device to the usb device on your computer.  It should look something like this:  /dev/tty.usbserial-A602FK45.  Look for the device in the /dev directory and it should show up as something with tty.usbserial

4.  type 'make' to compile the code in this directory

5.  type 'make usbprogram' to flash the microcontroller.

  The board should start running your code once the flashing is complete.
